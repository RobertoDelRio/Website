# Welcome to my First Website!

If you are reading this then that means that you have successfully accessed my test website on github!

There are a few things that I implement in my web design:

 1. Simplicity: I like to have my websites look clean and simple, I want my web visitors to be able to view my website without being confused.
 2. Elegance: Elegance goes a long way, if you make a website look beautiful, it adds more trust to the users accessing your site.
 3. Fun: Websites should be visually engaging, and users should be rewarded for interacting with the webpage!
